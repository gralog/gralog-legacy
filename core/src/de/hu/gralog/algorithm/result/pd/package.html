This package defines PersistenceDelegates for all
classes in {@link de.hu.gralog.algorithm.result}. Gralog
uses PersistenceDelegates to save these classes. It might
be neccessary for Plugin-Developers to subclass one of
these Delegates in order to provide their one savings-mecanism
for their AlgorithmResults.
