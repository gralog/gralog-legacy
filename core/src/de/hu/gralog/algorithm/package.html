This package defines all classes needed to implement algorithms in GraLog.

An Algorithm in Gralog is basically a JavaBean 
( please refer to <a href="../../../../../pdf/beans.101.pdf">Java Bean Specification</a> for
the definition of Java Beans ) that
implements {@link Algorithm}. Being a JavaBean means that
Gralog-Algorithms can specify their properties by using the JavaBeans-Framework that
provides functionality to define {@link java.beans.Customizer Customizers}, 
{@link de.hu.gralog.beans.propertyeditor PropertyEditor} and 
{@link de.hu.gralog.beans.proertydescriptor PropertyDescriptions}
for these properties respectively Algorithms. It basically means
that Gralog-Algorithm can be hugely customized taking arbitrary Parameters 
and providing their own
GUI-Components to edit these properties.

<h1>Plugin-Developers</h1>

Please see {@link Algorithm} for an example of how to implement your own Algorithm.
