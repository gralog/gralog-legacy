This package defines classes that are especially useful to define 
GraphBeans in Gralog. To define a GraphBean in Gralog you
should extend one of {@link DefaultPropertyChangeListenableBean} respectively
{@link DefaultPropertyAndDisplayChangeListenableBean} depending on
whether or not you want to fire DisplayChangeEvents. The interface
{@link GralogGraphBean} gives your bean the possibility to have
access to the {@link GralogGraphSupport}-instance it is currently
belonging to. 

<h1>Plugin-Developers</h1>

Please refer to the description of {@link de.hu.gralog.graph.GraphBeanFactory} if
you want to implement your own GraphBean for Gralog.
