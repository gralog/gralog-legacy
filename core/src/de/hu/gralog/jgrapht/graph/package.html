This is the title. And a second sentence.
and a new line.

The applet framework involves two entities: 
the applet and the applet context. An applet is an embeddable window (see the 
{@link java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra methods that the applet context 
can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet.
