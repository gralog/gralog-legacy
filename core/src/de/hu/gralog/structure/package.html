This package together with it's subpackages defines all classes needed
to define and use structures in GrALoG. 
<p>
A GrALoG-Structure is basically a mathematical graph that allows to specify
arbitrary properties for it's vertices, edges and the structure itself. In GrALoG
this is accomplished by using the JavaBeans-Framework to define vertices,
edges and a so called Structure-Bean object. It follows that
vertices, edges and the Structure-Bean are seen by GrALoG as JavaBeans which allows
them to be hugely customized, i.e. having arbitrary properties and providing
GUI-Components that are used by the GrALoG-User to customize these properties.
<p>
In GrALoG a structure is represented by the class {@link de.hu.gralog.structure.Structure}.

Please refer to {@link de.hu.gralog.structure.StructureTypeInfo} if you want to implement your
own type of GrALoG-Structure.
