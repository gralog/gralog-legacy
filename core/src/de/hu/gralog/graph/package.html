This package together with its subpackages defines all classes needed
to define and use Graphs in Gralog. 
<p>
A Gralog-Graph is basically a mathematical graph that allows to specify
arbitrary properties for its vertices, edges and the graph itself. In Gralog
this is accomplished by using the JavaBeans-Framework to define vertices,
edges and a so called GraphBean object. It follows that
vertices, edges and GraphBean are seen by Gralog as JavaBeans which allows
them to be hugely customize, i.e. having arbitrary properties and providing
GUI-Components that are used by the Gralog-User to customize these properties.
<p>
In Gralog a graph is represented by the class {@link GralogGraphSupport}.

Please refer to {@link GralogGraphTypeInfo} if you want to implement your
own Type of Gralog-Graph.
