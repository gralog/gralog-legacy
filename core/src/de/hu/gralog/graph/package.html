	This package defines all classes needed to implement Graphs in GraLog.

	All graphs in GrALoG are subclasses of {@link de.hu.gralog.graph.DirectedGraph} or {@link de.hu.gralog.graph.UndirectedGraph}. 
	Since these	graphs are typed ( with vertices and edges ) it is usually not necessary to subclass these classes. 
	The only case where this is necessary is if you want your graph to have properties which 
	cannot be stored in vertices or edges. In either case in order to define your own type of graph you 
	have to do the following:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>define your own graph-class as a subclass of {@link de.hu.gralog.graph.DirectedGraph} or {@link de.hu.gralog.graph.UndirectedGraph} - this
			step is optionally</li>
		<li>define your own vertex / edge classes as subclass of {@link de.hu.gralog.jgrapht.vertex.DefaultListablbeVertex} / {@link de.hu.gralog.jgrapht.edge.DefaultListableEdge} -
			this step is also optional</li>
		<li>define a TypeInfo-Class for your graph which has to be a subclass of {@link de.hu.gralog.graph.GraphTypeInfo} - this step is
		not optional</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Please see the documentation of classes mentioned with these steps for further information.
