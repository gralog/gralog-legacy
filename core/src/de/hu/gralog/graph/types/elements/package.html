This package defines the standard types for elements (vertices and edges) of
a Gralog-Graph. It also defines classes that should be used
by Plugin-Developers in order to define their own Gralog-Vertices and
-Edges. See {@link DefaultListenableVertex} for how to define your own
vertexType in Gralog and {@link DefaultListenableEdge} for how to define
your own EdgeType in Gralog.
