This package defines 
{@link de.hu.gralog.jgraph.cellview.DefaultVertexRenderer} and 
{@link de.hu.gralog.jgraph.cellview.DefaultEdgeRenderer} that
are used by GrALoG-Structures to render their vertices and edges. 
Renderers in GrALoG are {@link org.jgraph.graph.VertexRenderer} respectively
{@link org.jgraph.graph.EdgeRenderer} that implement 
{@link de.hu.gralog.jgraph.cellview.DisplayModeRenderer}.
Plugin-Developers who want to implement their own Vertex- or Edge-Renderers should
first have a look at the JGraph-Documentation on how to write Renderers for JGraph.
