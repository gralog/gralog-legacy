This package defines 
{@link de.hu.gralog.jgraph.cellview.DefaultVertexRenderer} and 
{@link de.hu.gralog.jgraph.cellview.DefaultEdgeRenderer} that
can be used by a Gralog-Graph to render its vertices and edges. 
Renderer in Gralog are {@link org.jgraph.graph.VertexRenderer} respectively
{@link org.jgraph.graph.EdgeRenderer} that implement {@link de.hu.gralog.jgraph.cellview.DisplayModeRenderer}.
Plugin-Developers who want to implement their own Vertex-, EdgeRenderers should
first have a look at the JGraph-Documentation on how to write Renderers for JGraph.
