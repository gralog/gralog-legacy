This library defines all classes needed to implement Graphs and Algorithms for GraLog.
<p>
The main purpose of this library is to give a starting point for plugin-developers. There
are two important packages in this library namely {@link de.hu.gralog.graph} and
{@link de.hu.gralog.graph.alg}. The first one contains all classes needed to implement 
your own types of graphs the second one contains all classes needed to implement 
your own algorithms.
